            My fascination with technology extends beyond fixing what's 
            broken. It is about understanding the full spectrum of a 
            system, from the tangible circuit boards to the intangible 
            lines of code that bring devices to life. This fascination 
            led me to venture into the domain of full stack development, 
            where I'm continuously expanding my skills in front-end and 
            back-end technologies.
